Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm an experienced software developer with a passion for creating robust and scalable applications. My expertise spans several programming languages and frameworks, including but not limited to:

- JavaScript (Node.js, React)
- Python (Django, Flask)
- Java (Spring Boot)
- C# (ASP.NET)
- Go
- SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL)

With over 6 years of professional experience, I've contributed to numerous projects in various domains, including e-commerce, fintech, and healthcare. I believe in the power of clean code and agile methodologies, and I am an advocate for test-driven development (TDD) and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices.

I love collaborating on open-source projects and sharing knowledge with the community. Some of my favorite personal projects include:

- A full-stack e-commerce application built with React and Node.js
- A machine learning model for predicting stock prices using Python
- An intuitive task manager developed in Java with Spring Boot

In my spare time, I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source initiatives, and mentoring junior developers. Iâ€™m also interested in cloud computing and DevOps practices, particularly with AWS and Docker.

Feel free to check out my pinned repositories to see some of my favorite work, and don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to collaborate on a project or just want to chat about tech!
